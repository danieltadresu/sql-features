*Playing a while with pl/sql. 
Every exercise is in the context of HR schema. Also, in the next lines i'll put every statement.*

I'm happy because i found a tool in oracle which allow us execute basedate querys and use oracl sql through google. That means that is not already necessary to download the desktop app. Its good for me because currently, i am working in a computer which dont have good components like a good processor or a good memories to run apps likes sql developer.
